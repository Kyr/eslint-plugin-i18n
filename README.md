# eslint-plugin-i18n

Plugin for eslint, that should reduce (for me) monkey job on implementing i18n for Contentmart

Heavily inspired by eslint-plugin-react/js-curly-bracer-presence

Should find and (try to) fix:
- `<input placeholder="untranslated message" />`
- `<div>Untranslated literal as children node</div>`
